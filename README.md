# Spotify Artist Network

An interactive Python Shiny app that visualizes Spotify artist collaboration networks with filters and multiple visualizations.

## Prerequisites

```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
shiny run spotify_shiny_app.py
```

The app will start and be available at **http://127.0.0.1:8000**
